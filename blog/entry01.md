# Why Business?
I chose business because my best subject in school is math. And business is doing math and i feel like it would be easy for me to work as and have a job in the future being easy because in the future i would want a job that i like doing and that it feels easy for me to do. Theres also a lot of options in terms of business. You can explore different types of businesess that make you feel a certain way about it. You can own your business and be the main person or you can be the person that talks to other people like investors or renting people about the shop. So theres so many choices you can do. I feel like the way technology is now, business will be more powerful and it would be better in the future when i start looking at jobs. Some articles that made me choose business was [technology business article](https://forbytes.com/blog/top-most-impressive-cases-when-technology-helped-businesses/) and [technology business article 2](https://business.cornell.edu/hub/2024/05/16/research-technology-is-changing-how-companies-do-business/). These artciles caught my eye because the different type of information i got while reading this was eye catching because i always feel that you can do so much different type of things in business. You can create your own business on anything you want or you can help someone with the business and it would be cool working with different people that can help you in the future.  

# EDP ( Engineering design process) 
Now that I finished stepped one ( finding your topic that you are interested at). Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. I plan on talking to the teacher and talking to my peers on how to research about business and websites i can use to create my own website and to make it to the top 3.

# Skills
A skill that i learned is how to google. I feel in todays world knowing how to google is a very important skill to learn because you will need techology in todays world. While i was seraching for a topic that interested me, i was learning how to google. I was looking through different types of websites to see if it interests me to create a website about it. I found out through googling that technogloy plays a big role in businessess because if you have advanced technology in a business it will become a powerful business and it will be a good job beccause you will earn lots of money.

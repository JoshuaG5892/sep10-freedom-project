# Why Business?
I chose business because my best subject in school is math. And business is doing math and i feel like it would be easy for me to work as and have a job in the future being easy because in the future i would want a job that i like doing and that it feels easy for me to do. Theres also a lot of options in terms of business. You can explore different types of businesess that make you feel a certain way about it. You can own your business and be the main person or you can be the person that talks to other people like investors or renting people about the shop. So theres so many choices you can do. I feel like the way technology is now, business will be more powerful and it would be better in the future when i start looking at jobs.

Now that I finished stepped one ( finding your topic that you are interested at). Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. I plan on talking to the teacher and talking to my peers on how to research about business and websites i can use to create my own website and to make it to the top 3.

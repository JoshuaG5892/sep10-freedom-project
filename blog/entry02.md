### Content
This week, I researched some of the gadegts that could be used for business, I was looked throguh websites like: [Gadget Website](https://www.hoppier.com/blog/office-gadgets-for-productivity) and [Gadget website 2](https://www.monitask.com/en/blog/ten-must-have-gadgets-for-business-leaders-and-project-managers). These are some of the unique gadegts that look and sound interesting:

* pen sccaners
* Smart pens
* electroinc notebooks
* self-charging phone case.
  
These are important to business owners or people who work in the business because it would make their jobs easier. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am between the second and third steps of the engineering design process. I have finished researching the information for my topic. Next i am going to brainstorm the possible solutions. For the next step I am going to brainstorm about how technology can be used in Business. 

### Skills
Some skills that i learned from researching this topic are time management and focusing.

#### Time managemnt 
Outside of School, I have things that i need to do like practicing sports, walking my dog, and working in programs. I also have been getting more school work as the year goes on, so i have to cut my practice and do school work because i still need to be focus on school and what i want to do in my life as i become older. 

#### Focusing 
Focusing is an important skill that i got. I usually get lazy and decide not to my work and play video games or just fall asleep. This is leaving my work incomplete and having my grade become worse. So then i decided to listen to music and do my work until i finish it. This improved my work ethic and started getting better grades. After i finish my work then i play games or take a nap but now i became more focus. 

### Summary
Im ready on what comes next and excited as im getting deeper into my topic.

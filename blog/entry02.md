### Content
This week, I researched some of the gadegts that could be used for business, I was looked throguh websites like: (https://www.hoppier.com/blog/office-gadgets-for-productivity) and (https://www.monitask.com/en/blog/ten-must-have-gadgets-for-business-leaders-and-project-managers). These are some of the unique gadegts that look and sound interesting:

* pen sccaners
